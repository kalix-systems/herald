## Emoji Scraper
---
this crate contains a script that pulls a json file that contains short names, codepoints and 
titles for emojis in canonical order and then translates it into a static struct that is referenced
from the emoji picker. it also finds and defines border indexes for the afforementioned static array
of emoji data structs. please commit all codegen that this crate provides to make building less arduous.
